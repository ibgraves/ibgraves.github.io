     Hello! My name is Isabelle Graves and am in my second year of Grad school. 
     I am getting my Master’s in Library and Information Science at Mizzou. 
     I moved to Columbia, Missouri last year. I now work at the State Historical Society of Missouri. 
     At work, I help patrons find reference material and create finding aids for manuscripts. 
     Working with letters from World War II soldiers, has been my favorite part of the job. 
     I have an energetic black Labrador named Dudley. We try to go on trails around Columbia a couple of times a week. 
     He also enjoys “pup cups” from Andy’s Frozen Custard restaurant. 
     When I have alone time, I love to read YA fiction and learn TikTok dances. 
     The only experience I have with code is through Khan Academy coding courses. 
     My expectations for this course are that I will be able to create future web pages on my own and have a firm understanding of html and CSS. 
     With these skills, I hope to be better equipped to help with IT problems that arise at work.
